# Text Based RPG Project

Andrew's coolest project! Wow!<br />
One paragraph of project description goes here.<br />
Briefly address the 5 W's. <br />
What is the project?<br />
Who made it? Did you make it independently or with a team?<br />
When did you make it? At what level of experience and proficiency were / are you?<br />
Why did you make it? For fun? For an assignment? How does it relect you as a person?<br />
Where did you make it? What school / class?<br />
Note for school project: this may be the only thing someone visiting your page reads. Try to make a great impression. Make someone want to hire you. This section will also be useful to you in the future to remind you about the project. 

## Demonstration

Add an animated gif of your program running. You can use ShareX, GIPHY Capture or another tool. https://blog.github.com/2018-06-29-GIF-that-keeps-on-GIFing/
Note for school project: This is a great way for friends and family to easily see your project in action. 
The markdown is  \!\[Alt text\]\(relative/path/to/img.png) <br />

## Documentation

For Python, use the output of your docstrings. For other languages, create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: \[Text to appear]\(URL) <br />
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename<br /> 
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. <br />
Sample: \[JavaDoc]\(https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html) <br /> <br />
[JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html)

## Diagrams

Such as a class diagram. <br /> 
The markdown is  \!\[Alt text\]\(relative/path/to/img.png) <br />
For example, this image 9919.png is saved to the docs folder in my repository and the markdown is  \!\[Sample Image\](docs/9919.png) <br />
 ![Sample Image](docs/9919.png)

## Getting Started

Being that this is a Java program, it should run on any machine as long as Java is installed. 
<br />
Note for real project: You want to be able to share your project and enable collaboration. 
<br />
Note for school project: You want a potential client or hirer to be able to run your program. 

## Built With

<br />Note for school project: Every section is an opportunity to make an impression. You could briefly add what you know about the IDE and describe your development skills.
